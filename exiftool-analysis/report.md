🧠 Inference
The file appears manipulated rather than an untouched original.

Multiple editing tools (Premiere Pro & GIMP) were used, with history showing repeated saves.

Metadata indicates it was assembled from at least two images and four video files — suggesting compositing or frame extraction from a video project.

Internal mismatch: file named .png but encoded as JPEG, possibly to disguise format or due to export settings.

No GPS or EXIF camera-specific data — typical for an image created entirely on a computer rather than captured by a camera.

Video metadata present (frame rate, pixel aspect ratio, timecode) further supports that this was derived from motion footage.
